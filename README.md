# Manual Trigger Example with Node.js

This repository demonstrates how to set up a GitHub Action for a simple Node.js application that can be triggered manually via a button. It includes automated testing and a placeholder for deployment.

## Project Structure

- `src/app.js`: Simple HTTP server application.
- `test/app.test.js`: Basic unit test example.
- `package.json`: Node.js project configuration.

## How to Use

Click the button below to manually trigger the workflow that builds, tests, and deploys the application.

## Testing

Run tests locally using:

```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment

The deployment step in the workflow is currently a placeholder. Modify it to deploy your application as needed.
```

### Reasoning:
- The README now includes a detailed description of the project’s functionality, usage, and structure.

#### Step 7: Push Changes and Test the Workflow

### Reasoning:
- After making all these changes, pushing the updates to GitHub will allow you to test the manual trigger workflow in a realistic scenario, including testing and deployment.
- This end-to-end setup demonstrates the practical usefulness of GitHub Actions and manual triggers in a real-world development environment.

### Final Summary

This project is now a complete end-to-end demonstration of using GitHub Actions for CI/CD. It includes a simple Node.js application with automated testing and a placeholder for deployment, all of which are triggered by a button in the repository’s README. This setup is suitable for testing the effectiveness of GitHub Actions and manual triggers in a professional development scenario.
